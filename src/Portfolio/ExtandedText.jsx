        In my role as an Associate Software Engineer at Teczon Labs, I have been
        responsible for building and maintaining web applications across various
        domains. My work involves designing and implementing features, reviewing
        code, writing and executing unit and integration tests, and managing
        deployment processes. I've also gained experience in developing
        co-working space management software and real estate platforms, where I
        handled API integration, front-end development using React.js and
        Tailwind CSS, and implementing secure authentication systems. I take
        pride in my project management skills, having successfully coordinated
        and contributed to multiple projects by ensuring effective
        documentation, meeting deadlines, and following software engineering
        standards. My technical expertise includes proficiency in Node.js,
        Express.js, React.js, MongoDB, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Git.
        Beyond development, I am passionate about machine learning, data
        science, and big data analytics. I also enjoy playing badminton and
        freelancing in my free time.
